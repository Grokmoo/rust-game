      Damn it those goblins were right on top of us!

      That was just a scouting party.  There are going to be a whole lot more of them, and they are not far behind us.

          Sounds like we should cut our losses and run.

      We can't go back, and I don't like our chances in a stand up fight with that many goblins.
      
      Our best chance is to find a clear path out of this valley, but we can't do that with goblins on top of us.

      The majority of the group will stay here for now with me.  We'll block the pass and try to set up some traps to slow down the main force of goblins.
      
      #player_name#, you scout to the North and try to find us a way out of this mess.  You will probably get in some fights, so you should take someone with you.

      Alright, we know the wagon went into these woods.  The question is: did it come out again?

      I'm not seeing much in the way of a clear trail.  #player_name#, see if you can spot anything further up the river.
      
      The rest of us will make ready for battle - I don't like the looks of this one bit.
