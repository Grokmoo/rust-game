      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - Well, not much is known, to be honest.  Some months back, a rockslide revealed a cave in the side of the hill.  Some folks went inside, and found the entrance.
      
      They say it goes on forever.  I don't know about that, but it is certainly mighty big.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - Well, Moonmouth has always just been a tiny fishing village, nothing of note, really.  All that has changed since the dungeon was discovered.  Town's been overrun with adventurers of all types.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - I reckon so.  An awful lot of people have gone in, and never come back out.  Types that can handle themselves, too.
      
      Myself, I haven't been inside and don't intend to.
