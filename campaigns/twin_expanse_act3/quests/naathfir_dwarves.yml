      Speaking with the Clan Chief of Naathfir, we came up with a plan.  I will travel East out of Naathfir and follow the Volgar river up to the Rose Pastures.  From there, I will sneak into Rose Lake, signal the Dwarves, and open the gates.  The dwarves will attack as a distraction, allowing me to get at Berkeley and end the war.
