      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - I am afraid to say that the road is impassable.  Our own forces are the least of your concerns.  An entire army of Berkeley's troops block your way.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - It is noble of you to offer.  We are able to fend off the Rose Guard well enough, but we only hold here because Berkeley himself has not yet ... graced us with his presence.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - On the eastern side of town, there is a passageway that leads out to the Volgar River.  It is a difficult journey, but follow the river upstream and you will reach the Rose pastures.  From there, you should be able to sneak into the city.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - When the time is right, open the city gates.  We will attack, giving you a chance to get at Berkeley himself.
