      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - I was just on my way here when I saw the smoke.  Looks like Berkeley's army came through here.
      
      Times are changin, that's for sure.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - You haven't heard?  The whole Rose Lake council was attacked and Berkeley has taken control of the city.
      
      He says it was the Dwarves.
