      The leader of the thugs in control of Oasis has given me a task to complete.  I am to travel Southwest of town and eliminate an infestation of drakes that have been harrassing the town.

      I have eradicated the drake's queen, which should drastically lower their activities for many years at least.  I should report back to the Boss in Oasis.

      I have been tasked with traveling to a Dracon encampment just outside Oasis and putting down any signs of rebellion there.  Then, I am to ensure they produce the expected tribute for Berkeley, the Leader.
