      First Councilor Aurelianus Berkeley of Rose Lake has gained control of the completed Aegis and revealed himself as the leader of a conspiracy against the city.
      
      He has teleported me and my companions to some far off location.  I must discover where I am, how to return to Rose Lake, and some way of defending against the power of the Aegis.

      I have discovered that I am a prisoner of sorts in the town of Oasis, located on the other side of the Sciedan Desert.  I must find a way to escape and return to the Twin Expanse.

      The leader of a small Dracon group near Oasis has given me the location of an ancient library containing information about the Aegis.  With luck, I will find some clue there on how to defeat Berkeley.

      I have found a book that appears to contain a history of the Aegis.  But I cannot read it.  The only one who can is the Sage, Rathezar, who lives alone on top of a lonely mesa.

      The book did not provide any clarity on defending ourselves from the Aegis.  But, Rathezar believes we will still have a chance by exploting Berkeley's hubris, or perhaps with trickery.  He also suggested we can return to the Twin Expanse via the Blazing Road, an ancient Dwarven tunnel system.  We can find the entrance in the Dracon camp.
