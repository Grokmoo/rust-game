      Ah you've arrived.  I know Berkeley's lackeys sent you.

      Of what I have heard, it seems you have been at the center of much of it.  So tell me, what truly happened?

      With the completed Aegis, Berkeley has control of a power that has no match in our modern world.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - The Aegis is a powerful magical artifact, from before the Sundering.  It gives its owner profound power over space and distance.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - The Aegis is one of a kind, a pre-Sundering artifact.  Magic of that complexity and power is simply not possible at present.
      
      Maybe, there is another artifact somewhere out there, which you could use to match it?  More likely, not.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - Yes, but that was before you confirmed that Berkeley has the completed Aegis in his possession.
      
      Rushing back to Rose Lake to fight him will simply result in your immediate death.

      Berkeley spent some time there in years past.  Perhaps you can discover something there to aide you.

      Say?  I have no idea.  I cannot read it.  This script is ancient Draconic.  It has neither been spoken or written for thousands of years.
