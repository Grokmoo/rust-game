      You were correct in your assumption.  It is in old Draconic.  And I can read it.

      This book appears to have been written about one hundred years after the Sundering.  It was a time of great changes for the Dracon people, as the Sundering devastated our lands.

      For some reason, perhaps its remote location from Xandala, or perhaps a quirk in its enchantments, the Calamity did not diminish its powers.]

      That's it.  The remainder is a long listing of the author's names, and titles.  Old Draconic is a verbose language.

      There is an ancient Dwarven tunnel, that used to stretch all the way from the Mountains of Naath across the Sciedan.  It was damaged in the Sundering, but is still passable.

      I believe you can do, it you are smart.  Good luck.
