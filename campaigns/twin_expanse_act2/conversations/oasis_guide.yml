      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - [c=888|A dark grizzled man addresses you.  He seems to have been expecting you.]
      
      Boss told me to help you get your bearings and then send you on - so that's what I'll do.
      
      This here is Oasis.  Only town of any size in the whole of the Sciedan.  You are maybe four or five hundred miles Northwest of where you were in the 'Spance.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - The town is a prison of sorts, for our honorable leader.  No walls, but the sand works just as well.
      
      You work with us, and your stay here will be much more ... pleasant.

      I'm just one of the hired hands around here.  Boss trusts me with jobs that require a bit more finesse than just bashin' heads.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - This used to be a right proper town, or so I'm told.  But, times in the desert are tough and the town got smaller.
      
      Leader came through here a few years back and took over.  Uses it as a prison now.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - Yeah, its a nice spot.  Nicer than here, anyway.  But, boss says you stay.  You want to leave, you gotta ask him.
      
      But don't get your hopes up.
