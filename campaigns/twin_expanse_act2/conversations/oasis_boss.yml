      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - [c=888|Before you stands a very large and heavily armored Dracon man.  He has a certain regal bearing to him.]
      
      Ah, you've arrived.  I'm sure my man has filled you in on your current situation, so we can skip that part.
      
      I am in charge of this town.  People call me boss.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - Our leader has given me the small task of maintaining order here, and that is what I intend to do.  As long as you do not interfere with that goal, we will not have a problem.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - I've also been informed you have skills which will prove useful to us.  I expect we'll be making use of them.  In due time.
      
      For now, you are free to move about Oasis.  You'll find escape to be quite impossible, so don't bother.
