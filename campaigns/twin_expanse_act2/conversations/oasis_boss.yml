      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - [c=888|Before you stands a very large and heavily armored Dracon man.  He has a certain regal bearing to him.]
      
      Ah, you've arrived.  I'm sure my man has filled you in on your current situation, so we can skip that part.
      
      I am in charge of this town.  People call me boss.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - Our leader has given me the small task of maintaining order here, and that is what I intend to do.  As long as you do not interfere with that goal, we will not have a problem.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - I've also been informed you have skills which will prove useful to us.  I expect we'll be making use of them soon.
      
      For now, you are free to move about Oasis.  You'll find escape to be quite impossible, so don't bother.
      
      When you are ready for your assignment, come see me.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - It is simple enough.  There is a large colony of drakes to the southeast of town.  The drakes have been getting larger and more dangerous, attacking my men and being a general nuisance.
