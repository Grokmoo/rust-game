      Hello, I don't believe we've met.  I am Aldius Fenk, mayor of this town.

      The goblins have become bolder of late, and many of our farms have been destroyed and people killed.
      
      We've even heard rumors of trolls traveling with the goblins!

      Someone or something is organzing the goblin tribes.  Normally, we could call on Rose Lake at times like these, but they have rejected my messengers.  I need skilled warriors to track down and eliminate the leader or leaders of this uprising.
      
      I am putting out a general call for aid - and a substantial reward.

      We honestly have very little to go on.  We don't even know whether there is a single chieftan organizing this or some outside group.
      
      The best place to start looking is in Wellswood forest and the surrounding hills.  It is goblin country though, so be prepared.

      I can't name numbers yet but any assistance will be met with our undying gratitude and a substantial sum as well.

      Most of the people here have a rather dim view of Rose Lake's propensity to help us.  But, they have helped in the past.  They are currently going through some political turmoil that is blocking that.
