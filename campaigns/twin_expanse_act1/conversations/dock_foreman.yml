      Yeah, right.  I know their leader is Gethruk.  He's holding them together.  Get rid of him, and they go back to fighting each other.

      You didn't seem too interesting in stopping them earlier.  Why should I stick my neck out now?

      I doubt you can talk much sense into Gethruk, but I'll mark where his hideout is on your map.  Its a cave south of town.  I overheard them talking about it.

      I don't know if you will be able to fight the whole lot of them, but I'll mark where his hideout is on your map.  Its a cave south of town.  I overheard them talking about it.
