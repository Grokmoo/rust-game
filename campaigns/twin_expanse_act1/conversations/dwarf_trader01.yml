      Thank you kindly, stranger.  Those bastards killed my guards.  I expect they would have killed me too except they thought the hold would pay a couple coins for me.
      
      Jokes on them now.

      I should gather up what I can and head to Rose Lake.  I'm very late on this shipment.  You should see the Trade Master for a reward.  He is usually near the warehouses on the North end of the tradesman's square.
