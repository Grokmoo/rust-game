      I am glad to see you return, #player_name#.  You have done well.  Very well indeed.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - Yes, I know.  I am surprised, and impressed that you dealt with Omonar so easily.  He has never before failed.

      You caused me quite a bit of consternation, when you took the staff.  All my plans, ruined - or so I thought.
      
      You can't even imagine how pleased I was when you walked into this chamber and simply handed it to me!

      Councillors - I'm afraid your services will no longer be required.

      As for you.  You may yet prove useful.  I think I will keep you in hand - for the moment.  Just make sure you don't overstay your welcome.
