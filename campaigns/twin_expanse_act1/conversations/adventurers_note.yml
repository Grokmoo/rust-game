      [c=888|This is a note you found on a body in Wellswood.]
      
      It was so stupid of me to come here.  Everyone told me, but I was too stupid to listen.  Stupid and stubborn.
      
      I have been trapped in these woods for three days.  I could try to run for it, but the goblins are everywhere.  Even now I can hear them moving about in the trees.
      
      I don't think I'm going to make it.  If anyone finds this, please don't make the same mistakes I did.
