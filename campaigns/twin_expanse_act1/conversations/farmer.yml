      I see you are up.  Looking much better.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - Yeah, I pulled you out of the rocks.  Found you up the cliffside a ways north of town.
      
      Brought you back here in my wagon.  That was almost a week ago now.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - I honestly don't know - I guess you are just really lucky.  I had wandered further from town than I usually do, when I spotted you laying in some rocks.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - I did look around but I didn't see anyone else.  You were real lucky to survive what you did.  If there were others with you, I wouldn't count on finding them in one piece.
