      But this news worries me greatly.  It sounds like there is some larger plot at work.

      Oh, and don't forget your reward.

      We've even heard rumors of trolls traveling with the goblins!

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - Someone or something is organzing the goblin tribes.  Normally, we could call on Rose Lake at times like these, but they have rejected my messengers.  I need skilled warriors to track down and eliminate the leader or leaders of this uprising.
      
      I am putting out a general call for aid - and a substantial reward.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - We honestly have very little to go on.  We don't even know whether there is a single chieftan organizing this or some outside group.
      
      The best place to start looking is in Wellswood forest and the surrounding hills.  It is goblin country though, so be prepared.
