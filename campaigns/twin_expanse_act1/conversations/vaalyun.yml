      Yes, I know of you.  You traveled with a group including an elf - Ethel - into the wood searching for a caravan.  Do you know what became of him?

      I was afraid you might say that.  In truth, I hold out little hope for his survival.  Still, I would like to know for certain.

      Ethel was carrying something valuable to me and I would like to recover it.
      
      You knew and traveled with him, so I think you are my best chance to do this.  I propose we travel together and attempt to recover this item.

      It is a personal matter, and would mean nothing to you.  The item is only of value to me.
      
      What do you say?
