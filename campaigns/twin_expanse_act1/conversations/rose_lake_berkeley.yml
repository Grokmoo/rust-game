      Greetings, #player_name#.  I am Aurelianus Berkeley.
      
      Word has reached us of your exploits.  Most impressive.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - This is dire news indeed:  A conspiracy against Rose Lake and indeed the entire Twin Expanse, involving multiple mages of the highest Circle.
      
      I am most curious about this artifact uncovered under the Lake - the Aegis.  You have it with you?

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - I suppose an explanation is in order.  [c=888|He gathers his breath.]
      
      The Aegis is a magical artifact from before the Sundering, before magical power was limited in this world.
      
      Hundreds of years ago, my ancestor came to this area.  He happened upon another piece of the artifact, the Aegis Gem.  With its power of clairvoyance, they were able to found Rose Lake and gain great power.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - Over time, the Council has come to fear the Gem's power, and the visions it gives.  We have not used it in centuries.  It has been a secret, known only to us.

      [c=888|Berkeley looks at you.]
      
      You have shown great courage and skill in coming this far.  Perhaps you can help us.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - With the recovery of the main body of the staff, it is clear that our enemies are trying to reassemble the full Aegis staff.  I do not know what powers it will bestow, but it will certainly not be good for Rose Lake.
      
      [c=888|He pauses.]
      
      We have received reliable information that the killer is still in the region, in the Naathfir mines.  Go there, exact justice upon the murderer, and return what was stolen.  The gem must not remain in hands hostile to Rose Lake.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - I'm afraid that will not do.  The information you have brought us confirms the existance of a conspiracy against the city.  We do not know how many among us may be spies.  If we mobilize, it will almost certainly alert our enemies, and reveal that we know what they are up to.
