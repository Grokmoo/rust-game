      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - Yes, yes.  You see, there is a rather delicate matter of some funds I am owed.  A sum of 500 coins - nothing particularly large, you see, but I cannot allow debts to be unpaid for this long.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - Anyway, the debtor is a Rodian they call Weasel.  He's usually found in the Warrens on the north end of town.
      
      He's really being quite unreasonable.  I need someone who can show a bit of strength, and get him to pay up.
