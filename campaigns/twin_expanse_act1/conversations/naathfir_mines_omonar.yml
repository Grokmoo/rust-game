      Right on time.
      
      Greetings.  I am called Omonar.  And this mine is your tomb.

      [c=6868FF|#target_name#] - I'm afraid you are much too late.  We have already taken the Aegis tailpiece from these mines, and the gem from Rose Lake.  And the staff - that's being secured as we speak.
      
      All three pieces are ours.  You have lost.  And now, you will die.

      You truly know so little of who you are fighting?  Simply pathetic.
