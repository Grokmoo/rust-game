      Hello, what can I do for you?  [c=888|He looks you over.] Or perhaps, you can do something for me?

      Well, you look you can handle yourself - and I know all that equipment is expensive.

      We've been expecting a large caravan of good from Naathfir - Dwarven arms and armor, mostly.  They are desperately needed by the Rose Guard.

      Last word we received is that the good have been delayed - it sounds like the problem may be banditry.
      
      I need good warriors to head to Naathfir and assist in whatever way is neccessary to ensure the goods are delivered in a timely fashion.

      I'm afraid every available guardsman is needed at home at the moment.  I'm sure you've heard the rumors going around.  I won't confirm or deny any of them, but suffice it to say the city is on high alert.

      There is a reward, of course.  For someone such as yourself, some of the choicest pieces from the shipment would be fitting, no?

      The current equipment is adequate, I do not deny.  But, the Council wants the Guard using only the finest.  I'm afraid I can say no more.
