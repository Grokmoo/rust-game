      The Council sent word to expect you.  What you seek is inside the mines.
      
      Be warned though, the situation inside is not pretty.

      I'm afraid there has been a disturbance in the mines.  No access is allowed at this time.

      As I said, there has been a disturbance.  More than that, I cannot say.
