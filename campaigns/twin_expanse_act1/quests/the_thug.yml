      I learned that the thug, Guthrek, has been extorting money and goods from some of the local farmers.  The local guard seems unwilling or unable to step in.

      I saw a group of thugs shaking down some workers on the docks.  This problem appears to be widespread in Wellswood.

      I entered the thug's hideout.  Gethruk now lies dead.  I should speak to the Mayor for some kind of reward.
