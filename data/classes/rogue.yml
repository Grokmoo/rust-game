  Rogues have a variety of skills both in and out of combat, making them a valuable addition to any party.  They are usually poorly suited to standing on the front lines of combat, but instead must attack from the flanks and shadows, waiting for the perfect moment before unleashing a devastating strike with surgical precision.

      Striking from the shadows when least expected, Assassins can bring down the most dangerous targets in seconds, ideally giving their prey no time to react.  They can be quickly brought down themselves, though, if caught out in the open.
