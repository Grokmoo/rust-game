  Bards are traveling poets and musicians who make use of a long and storied magical tradition.  Bards are able to learn a variety of songs, each one with different magical effects.  Songs can be enhanced or modified by adding additional verses, melodies, and changing rhythms.  While reciting a basic song can be done at any time, Bards rely on a limited pool of inspiration in order to come up with new and exciting variations, maximizing their songs' overall effectiveness.
