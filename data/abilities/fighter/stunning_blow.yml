  You make an attack with your weapon with the intent to confuse and disorient an opponent.  The attack is made against the target's Fortitude Defense.
  On a hit, the target loses 4 AP on their next action.  On a graze, they lose 2 AP.  On a critical hit, they lose 6 AP.  If the AP lost is more than
  the target would otherwise have for their round, they will continue to make up the remainder of the lost AP on subsequent round(s).
