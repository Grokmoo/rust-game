  You strip magical defenses from the target creature.  This includes spells that provide resistance to a damage type or general defenses, including Air Shield, Fire Shield, Rock Armor, Layer of Bark, Spirit Defense, Resist Elements, and Absorb Energy.
  
  If the target has a ward activated, the two spells will cancel each other out, removing the ward but leaving any other magical defenses intact.
