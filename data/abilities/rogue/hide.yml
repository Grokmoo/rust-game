  You move about unseen and unnoticed.  Enemies will not target you while you remain hidden.  Upon activating this ability and each round thereafter your opponents get a chance to spot you, based on their Perception and how far away you are from them.  Actions such as attacking or using most abilities will immediately end your hidden state.
