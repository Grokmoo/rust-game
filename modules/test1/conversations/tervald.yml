      I'm not seeing much in the way of a clear trail.  #pc_name#, see if you can spot anything further up the river.
      
      The rest of us will make ready for battle - I don't like the looks of this one bit.

      And #pc_name#, watch yourself.  If you spot and trouble, you come back here as quick as you can.  Don't be a hero.
